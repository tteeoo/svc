# Example Assembly Programs

This directory contains some example assembly programs written for the Simple Virtual Computer.

The `lib` directory contains a standard library of sorts.

See [`sva/README.md`](https://github.com/tteeoo/svc/blob/main/sva/README.md) for an explanation of the assembly language.
